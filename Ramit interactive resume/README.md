# My Personal Profile Page

In this project, I have made a personal profile webpage to practice  HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT skills. I customized the page with my own photos and information and made the website interactive. I also used CSS to change colors, add animations, and improve the look of the page. The CSS properties used for styling the profile photo were transform and transition. 

I further added three pages; experience.html , hobbies.html and certificates.html

Broswers tested for compatibility:
